# OMEO
Online Minecraft Enchantment Oracle, or: how to get that sweet OP gear in Minecraft.

## How to contribute?

### Prerequisites
OMEO is built to be ran as a stand-alone static HTML web app, which can be served from anywhere. It makes use of plain jQuery only, without any further external dependencies.

### Used tools
For now I'm just using Notepad++ for coding, FireFox and a local Python web server for testing, and Inkscape for the artwork.

### Developing and testing outside GitHub
Because it's a static stand-alone web app, you can just copy the repository to your own computer, start the supplied local Python web server, open the pages directly in your browser, and start hacking away from there.  This Should Just Work.

### Pull requests
OMEO is an on-the-side hobby project for me, which means I won't be able to support it full-time. If you think of a useful contribution, please try to work it out yourself first, and then send me a pull request when it works.
