        <dt>December 9, 2024</dt>
          <dd>The 'Max out' button for your desired item now no longer pushes in cursed enchantments -- who wants those anyway...  If you want to add those too, you can add them manually afterwards.</dd>
        <dt>December 9, 2024</dt>
          <dd>Fixed the list of entered items not saving correctly on some mobile browsers.</dd>
        <dt>October 27, 2024</dt>
          <dd>Added a &quot;Max out&quot; button to the desired item section to more quickly get to the most OP items possible.<br>

        <dt>October 11, 2024</dt>
          <dd>Invalid item counts in the &quot;My Items&quot; section will now be highlighted as soon as they are entered.  They will also no longer prevent page unloads, saving the count as a '1' instead.</dd>
        <dt>October 11, 2024</dt>
          <dd>Changed the way enchantments can be entered so that conflicts or dupes can no longer be created but are shown greyed out instead.</dd>
        <dt>September 25, 2024</dt>
          <dd>Switched the &quot;I want to have&quot; and &quot;My items&quot; sections for a more intuitive experience. The &quot;My items&quot; section can now be filled in automatically with the parts needed for your desired item.<br>

        <dt>September 20, 2024</dt>
          <dd>Enchantment level options are now easier to fill in.<br>
            <span class="credit">Suggested by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/farseekarmageddon/">farseekarmageddon</a> at <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/technicalminecraft/comments/1fl7xre/love_to_get_feedback_on_new_enchantment_planner/">reddit</a>.</span></dd>
        <dt>September 13, 2024</dt>
          <dd>This site now has a proper contact form, replacing the GitHub discussions placeholder solution.</dd>
        <dt>September 6, 2024</dt>
          <dd>Added the &quot;Rename too&quot; checkbox to the desired item section.<br> <span class="credit">Suggested by VSP.</span></dd>
        <dt>September 6, 2024</dt>
          <dd>The list of possible item combinations does not show source items anymore.  They were often totally inappropriate, and if not you would already know they existed anyway :)</dd>
        <dt>September 6, 2024</dt>
          <dd>Improved the combined item rating algorithm.  All found combined items are now sorted into four match groups (exact matches, better matches, lesser matches and mixed matches), the items within these groups are now sorted on 'bestness', and only the top 5 of each group is shown in order not to overwhelm.</dd>
        <dt>August 25, 2024</dt>
          <dd>On the recipe page, the link back to the OMEO home page now includes the originating filled-in data, so you or someone you send the recipe page link to can continue exploring other options later.</dd>
        <dt>August 24, 2024</dt>
          <dd>Added icons next to the items.<br>
            <span class="credit">Suggested by VSP.</span></dd>
        <dt>August 24, 2024</dt>
          <dd>Added the items Mace and Brush, and the enchantments Breach, Density and Wind Burst.</dd>
        <dt>August 23, 2024</dt>
          <dd>OMEO already threw a fresh unenchanted source item in the mix if it couldn't find source items of the correct type but without enchantments on them. OMEO now also does the same if it cannot find source items of the correct type but without a prior work penalty.</dd>
        <dt>August 18, 2024</dt>
          <dd>Initial beta release<br>
            <span class="credit">Thank you VSP!</span></dd>
